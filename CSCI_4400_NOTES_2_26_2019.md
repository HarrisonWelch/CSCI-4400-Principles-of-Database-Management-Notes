## Venn Diagrams

* Union
  * A or B
* Interesction
  * A and B
* Difference
  * A-B
    * all of B, except anything in A
  * B-A
    * all of B, except anything in A

## Relation Set ops

* Multiply
  * based on rows
  * 8 row by 3 row gives 24 rows
* Divide
  * Filter table by a column of similar name
* Join
* Data dictionary
  * desc of all data tabls and their data types
* System Catalog
  * desc all objs within the DB
* Homonyms and synonyms should be avoided
  * Homonnyms - sound the same
    * C_name is customer or currency
  * Synonym - diff names for same attr
    * car and automobile
* Relationships within the Relational Database
  * One-to-many (1:M)
    * Normal
  * One-to-One (1:1)
    * One entity can be related to only one entity
  * Many-to-Many (M:M)

## Entity Relationships

## Codd's Realational Rules

* Information - all info must be logically reped column values and rows
* Guaranteed access - all info is reachable
* Systematic treatment of NULL - Nulls must be handled independent of data type
* Dynamic online catalog - metadata must be stored and managed as normal data. be under one language on control
* View catalog - any view that is updatable
* High-level insert, update, and delete - support the given details
* Phyiscal data Independence - env makes no diff on data
* logical data IND - apps are unaffected
* Integrity IND - all constraints must be definable
* Distribution IND - end user is affected by data location
* Nonsubversion - if support low-level access, the user must not get be integrity constraints
* Rule Zero - All preceding rules are based on notion of relational, a database must use this relation facility for management

## Date and Time data types

## Query: before a certain date

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  Orders
WHERE
  OrderDate < '1996-11-01';
```

## Query: before 1996

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  Orders
WHERE
  OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-01-01' AND '1996-12-31';
```

## Query: before 1996 new way

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  Orders
WHERE
  YEAR(OrderDate) = 1996;
```

## Query: and month

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  Orders
WHERE
  YEAR(OrderDate) = 1996 and MONTH(OrderDate) = 5;
```

## Query: tally up the freight

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(Frieght)
FROM
  
```

## Query: most recent

```sql
SELECT
  TOP(1) OrderDate
FROM
  ORDERS
ORDER BY
  OrderDate;
```

> 1996-07-04

## Query: least recent

```sql
SELECT
  TOP(1) OrderDate
FROM
  ORDERS
ORDER BY
  OrderDate;
```

> 1998-05-06

## Query: avg feight

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(Freight)
FROM
  ORDERS;
```

## Query: avg freight of 1996

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(Freight)
FROM
  ORDERS
WHERE
  YEAR(OrderDate) = 1996;
```

## Query: avg freight of 20 years of data

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(Freight)
FROM
  ORDERS
GROUP BY
  YEAR(OrderDate);
```

NOTE: OUT OF ORDER DATA

## Query: avg freight of 20 years of data ordered

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(Freight)
FROM
  Orders
GROUP BY
  YEAR(OrderDate)
ORDER BY
  YEAR(OrderDate);
```

## Query: avg freight of 20 years of data ordered with year

```sql
SELECT
  YEAR(OrderDate), AVG(Freight)
FROM
  Orders
GROUP BY
  YEAR(OrderDate)
ORDER BY
  YEAR(OrderDate);
```

## Query: avg freight of 20 years of data ordered with year with column names

```sql
SELECT
  YEAR(OrderDate) as 'Year Ordered', AVG(Freight) as 'Average Freight'
FROM
  Orders
GROUP BY
  YEAR(OrderDate)
ORDER BY
  YEAR(OrderDate);
```

## Query: Month avg freight

```sql
SELECT
  MONTH(OrderDate) as 'Month Ordered', AVG(Freight) as 'Average Freight'
FROM
  Orders
GROUP BY
  MONTH(OrderDate)
ORDER BY
  MONTH(OrderDate);
```
