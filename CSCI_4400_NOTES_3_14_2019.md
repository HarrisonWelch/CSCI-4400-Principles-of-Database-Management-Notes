## Data Tables and Normalization

* Normalization: eval and correction table structures to minimize data redundacies
  * Reduces data anomalies
* Structural point of view
* Denormaliszaiton: produces a lower normal form
  * for preformance reasons

## The Normalization Process (1 of 5)

* Objective is to ensure that each table conforms to the concept of well formed relations
  * Each table is single subject
  * No data item will be unnecessarily stored in more than one table
  * All nonproime attributes in a table are dependent on the primary key
* Ensures at least 3NF

## Pyramind of normal forms

|NF|Characteristic|Section|
|--|--------------|-------|
|1NF|Table format, no repeating groups, and PK identified | 6-3a
|2NF|1NF and no partial dependencies
|3NF|2NF and no tranisitive dependencies
|Boyce-Codd|
|4NF|

## Functional

|Concept|Definition|
|-|-|
|functional dependence| attr B is fully functional
|functional dependence (general defn)|1NF and no partial dependencies
|Fully functioning composite key| if b is functionally dependent on a on a composite key `A` but not a subset of A then B is fully dependent on A

# The normalization process (5 of 5)

* Partial dependency: functional dependence in which the determinant is only part of the primary key
* Transitive dependency: functional dependence on non-primary key
