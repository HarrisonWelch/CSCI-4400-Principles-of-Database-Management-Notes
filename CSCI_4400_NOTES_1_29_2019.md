Dr. Church has taken over the class in Dr. Myers medical absense

* Relational Databases
  * MS Access
  * Oracle
  * Postgresql
  * MySQL
    * now called MarieDB
  * MarieDB
  * SQLite3
    * NOTE: Dr. Church says this is very easy to use
* Hierarchial
  * NoSQL
  * XML
    * consider
  * JSON
  * YAML

height of a DB = # of rows/entries

width of a DB = # of columns/fields for a table or entry

language of SQL, structured query language

## NonRelational DB Example

```
root-> students
      -> MC
        -> StuID
        -> Name
        -> GPA 
    -> classes
    -> rooms
    -> professors
```

## Chapter 1

### Why DBs?

* Ubiquitous - abundant, global, and everywhere
* Pervasive - unescapable, pervalent, and persistent

* Databases make data persistent and shareable in a secure way
  * Specialized structures that allow computer based systems to store, manage, and retrieve data very quickly

# __A Person with a watch knows what time it is, a person with two watches is never sure__

* Data consists of raw facts
  * not yet processed
  * building blocks of info
* Information results from processing raw data to reveal meaning

## Introducing the Database

* Shared, integrated computer structure that store data
  * End-user data: raw facts of interest to the end user
  * Metadata: data about data, through which the end-user data is integrated and managed
    * describes data
* Data base management (DBMS)
  * Collection of programs
  * Manages the DB structure
  * Controls access to data stored in the DB

## Role and Advs of the DBMS

* Database management system: intermediary between the user and the DB
  * Enables data to be shared
  * Presents the end user with integrated view of data
  * Provides more efficient and effective data management
  * Improves sharing, security, integration, access, productivity, and decision-making

## Role and Adv of the DBMS (2 of 2)

Common to see a cylinder as a DB metaphor

## Types of DB

* single-user
* multi-user
  * work group
  * enterprise
* Classification by location
  * center:
  * distributed: 
  * cloud: gives designed performance
* Classification by data type
  * General purpose database: wide variety
  * Discipline-specific database: data focused on specific subject
  * Operational database: designed to support a company's day-to-day operations
* Analytical database: stores historical data and business metrics used exclusively ...
* Databases can be classified to reflect the degree to which data is structure
  * Unstructured data exists in its original (raw) state
  * structured data results from formatting
  * semistructured data: processed
* Extensible markup language (XML)
  * represents data elements in textual format
* Focuses on design
  * well: generate accurate and valuable data
  * poor: difficult to trace errors

## Evolution of File System Data Processing

* Manual file systems
  * Accomplished through a system of file folders and filing cabinets
* Computerized file systems
  * Data processing (DP) specialist created a computer-based system to track data and produce
* File system redux:

## Evolution of File Systems Data Processing (2 of 3)

* Data - Raw facts, such as telephone number a birth date, a customer name
* Field- a character or group of characters
* record - row;
* file - a collection of related records

## Structural and Data Dependence

* Structure dependent
  * 
* Structure independent
  * 

## Structural and Data Dependence (2 of 2)

* Data dependence
  * data access changes when data storage characteristics change
* Data independence
  * easily change format

## Data redundancy

* Unneeded storing of the same data at different places
  * islands of data of information (i.e. scattered data locations)
  * Increases ...
* Poor data security
* data errors
* data integrity
* data consisitency

## Data Anomalies

* Develop when not all of the required changes in the redudant data are made successfully
  * Update anomalies
  * Insertion anomalies
  * Deletion anomalies

* DB systems
  * Logically related data stored in a single logical repository
  * Physically distributed among multiple storate files
  * Distributed

## SQL - structured query language

Each of the different system used a slightly diff verison of SQL

### ADOdb

Abstract database objects

## DB System Environment (1 of 2)

* Database system: organization of components that define and regulate the collection, storage, management

## DBMS functions

* Data dictionary management
  * Data dictionary: stores definition of data elements
* Data storage management
  * Performance tuning ensures efficient performance
* Data transformation and presentation
  * Data is formatted to conform to logical expections
* Security management
  * Enforces user security and data privacy
