## SQLite examples

### Query Schema

```
.schema
```

Returns the schema of all tables (and more probably)

### Query: Schema specific table

```
.schema albums
```

### Query: Math


```sql
10 / 3, 2 + 4
```

returns

```
3|6
```

### Query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM albums GROUP BY artist
```

### Query: schema tracks

```sql
.schema tracks
```


### Query: get longest songs

```sql
SELECT name, milliseconds, albumid FROM tracks ORDER BY albumid ORDER BY milliseconds DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## Query: crate from CSV

create table

```sql
CREATE TABLE players (name TEXT, team TEXT, position TEXT, games INTEGER);
```

look at schema

```sql
.schema players
```

returns text as appears

```
CREATE TABLE players (name TEXT, team TEXT, position TEXT, games INTEGER);
```

```
.mode csv
```

```
.import baseball.csv players
```

Now look!

```sql
SELECT * FROM players;
```

Returns the CSV! Hooray!

NOTE: the mode appears to make bars appear as commas

## Query bats per game

```sql
SELECT name, atbats / (games * 1.0) AS bpg FROM players ORDER BY bpg;
```

# Views

```sql
SELECT * FROM tracks INNER JOIN albums ON albums.albumid=tracks.albumid INNER JOIN media_types ON media_types.MediaTypeID = tracks.MediaTypeId INNER JOIN genres ON genres.GenreID = tracks.GenreID;
```

## Create View

```sql
CREATE VIEW trackInfo AS SELECT * FROM tracks INNER JOIN albums ON albums.albumid=tracks.albumid INNER JOIN media_types ON media_types.MediaTypeID = tracks.MediaTypeId INNER JOIN genres ON genres.GenreID = tracks.GenreID;
```

## Query: look at tables

```
.tables
```

prints all tables

## More views

NOTE: most DB engines will let you modify a View, SQLite will not let you

## Query UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE albums SET title='Restless and Tame' WHERE title='Restless and Wild';
```

Now look at the record

```sql
SELECT * FROM albums WHERE albumid=3;
```
