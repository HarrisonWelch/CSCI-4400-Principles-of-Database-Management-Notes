## Partial Dependencies

1. A Composite Key
2. An attribute which depends on another attribute

## Example of partial dependencies

* A and C are a composite key of a table
* A depends on B
* Solution: separate the ABC table into an AB table and AC table
  * AB table has a pkey of A
  * BC table has a composite key 

## Transitive Dependency

* property depends on a property which then depends on another property
* non-key attribute that depends

## Example of partial dependencies

* Table A B C
* A is our primary key
* B depends on A
* Problem: C depends on B
  * A -> B -> C (not allowed in 3NF)
* Solution: two tables. a table B depends on A, then another table where C depends on B

## 3AC instructions

1. x = y op z
2. x = op y
3. x = y
4. goto L
5. if x goto :
    1. ifFalse x goto L
6. if x relop y goto L

7. Procedure calls and returns

```c
param x
call p,n  // where p is procedure and n is number of arguments
y = call p,n
return y
```

8. Indexed copy instructions

```c
x = y[i]
x[i] = y
```

9. Address and pointer assignment

```c
x = &y
x = *y
*x = y
```

## Example

```c
do i = i + 1; while (a[i] > v);
```

```c
t_1 = i + 1
i = t_1
t_2 = i + 8 // assuming this is element size for each array
t_3 = a[t_2]
```

## The `scope`

* The scope of a declaration is the part of the program where the declaration is active

## Static `scoping`

* scope of declaration is the block in the declaration appears except for any enclosing block where a new declaration of the same name occurs

```c
{
  int x;
  .
  .
  .
  .
  .
  . // the scope of this x extends to this point 
  {
    double x; // new x that overrides the outer x
    .
    .
    . // scope of nested x 
  }
  . // the scope of x picks up from where it left off
  .
  .
  .
  .
  .
  .
  . // the scope of the outer x ends
}
```

## `Symbol Table`

* The ST contains an entry for every declaration in the program, along with any predefined names
* Anything that has a name potentially has a symbol on the symbol table
* Entries are typically never removed from a symbol from a symbol table
  * Multple declaration of the same name in different scopes (possibly non-overlapping scopes), entries that you stored may be needed later when they become visible again
  * Entries for a fields of a record need to be available outside a record declaration
  * Some languages allow names to be used before they are declared
  * Debuggers may need access to symbols after compilation
