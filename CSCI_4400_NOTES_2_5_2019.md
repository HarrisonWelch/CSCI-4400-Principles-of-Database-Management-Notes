## Query: Repeat Animals Table

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Animal
```

## Query: addition

```sql
SELECT 1 + 1;
```

returns 2

## Query: Get pet names

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Animal;
```

Problem: returns blanks and duplicates

## Query: Get pet names V2

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Animal
WHERE name IS NOT NULL;
```

Better!

`IS NOT NULL` removes blanks (pets that not have names)

## Query: Get pets w/o names

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Animal
WHERE name IS NULL;
```

Gives the pets w/out names, but we have a table of blanks we can't read

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  name IS NULL;
```

# What are the prices for the pets?

## Query: get pets of less than `x` dollars

```sql
SELECT
  Category, Breed, ListPrice
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  listPrice <= 20 AND listPrice >= 10;
```

### Operators in SQL

```
Relational                Operators
Equals                    =, IS
Not equals                !=, IS NOT
Less than                 <
Greater than              >
Less than or equal to     <=
Greater than or equal to  >=
```

## Query: Between 10 and 20

```sql
SELECT
  Category, Breed, ListPrice
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  listPrice BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
```

Math time, let's express this in math

1. SQL: Attribute BETWEEN 10 and 20
2. Math: Attribute is in the range [a,b]

Note this includes a and b in the range, parenthesis excludes a and b

### Query: ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT
  Category, Breed, ListPrice
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  ListPrice BETWEEN 10 AND 125
ORDER BY
  ListPrice;
```

How do we order in descending?

### Query: descending ORDER BY (most expensive)

```sql
SELECT
  Category, Breed, ListPrice
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  ListPrice BETWEEN 10 AND 125
ORDER BY
  ListPrice DESC;
```

### Query: pet names that start with either a,b,c,d,e

```sql
SELECT
  Name
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  Name BETWEEN 'A' and 'E';
```

and for casing concerns:

```sql
SELECT
  Name
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  Name BETWEEN 'A' and 'E' OR
  Name BETWEEN 'a' and 'e';
```

---

## Operator: 'Like'

similar to equality, but allows more interesting searches

```sql
SELECT
  Name
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  Name LIKE 'Sh*';
```

`LIKE` has its own mini-language

uuhhh, switch to A b/c

```sql
SELECT
  Name
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  Name LIKE 'A*';
```

## Query: all names begin with A and have 6 letters

```sql
SELECT
  Name
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  Name LIKE 'A?????';
```

A `?` means a single character of ANY type

---

## Regular Expression

LIKE

* `*`: any text of any size
* `?`: any one character

REGEXP

* `A.*`: All words containing `A`
* `.`: Any one character

Regex uses atoms

* Any character is an atom
* Any character grouped w/ parenthesis is an atom
* Atoms can be modified

## Query: Regex

```sql
SELECT
  Name
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  Name REGEXP 'A.*';
```

## Query: LIKE with brackets

```sql
SELECT
  Name
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  Name LIKE '[A-E]*';
```

Using the brackets from a to b

## Query: ends in 'e'

```sql
SELECT
  Name
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  Name LIKE '[A-E]*e';
```

---

## New term `'IN'`

```sql
SELECT
  Name, Category, Breed
FROM
  Animal
WHERE
  Category IN ('Bird', 'Fish');
```
