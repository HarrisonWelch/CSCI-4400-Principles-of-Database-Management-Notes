## SQL Triggers

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER <name>
ON
  <table>
FOR
  <operations>
AS
  <declare variables>
  <select to use variables>
IF
  <condition>
BEGIN
  rollback transaction
  RAISEERROR('Message', 16, 10)
END
```

## 5 props of database transactions

* Atomicity
  * All operations of a transaction must be completed; if not the transaction is aborted
* Consistency
  * Permanence of database’s consistent state
* Isolation
  * Data used during transaction cannot be used by second transaction until the first is completed
* Durability
  * Ensures that once transactions are committed they cannot be undone or lost
* Serializability
  * Ensures that the schedule for the concurrent execution of several transactions should yield consistent result

## Concurrency Control

* coordinate many connections
  * put into a Queue.
  * isolation is important
* problems caused
  * lost udates
  * uncommited data
  * inconsistent retreivals

## Problems with concurrency

* Lost Update
  * the data is as it was last updated
* Uncommitted data
* Inconsistent retrievals

## The Scheduler

* Establishes the order in which the ops are executed
* Bases actions on concurrent control alogorithms
* Creates serializable schedule
  * interleaved communication

## Concurrency Control with Locking Methods

* Locking methods facilitate isolation of data items used in concurrently executing transactions
  * Lock: exclusive data
  * Pessimistic locking: use of locks on assumption that conflict between transaction is likely
  * Lock manager: responsible for preventing collision

## Lock Granularity (1 of 5)

* Indicaties the level lock use
  * DB lock
  * table
  * page
  * row
  * field

## Lock Types (1 of 2)

* Binary Lock
  * two states, T F
* Exclusive lock
  * related to transaction
* shared lock
  * related to a pool of things
  * thread group can access

## Two-Phase Locking to Ensure Serializability

* Governing rules
  * 2 transaction cannot have conflicting locks
  * No unlock operation can precede a lock operation
  * No data are affected until locks are obtained

## Two-Phase Locking to Ensure Serializability 2

* Image
* Growing phase and shrinking phrase

## Deadlock

* Occur when 2 transactions wait indefinitely for each other to unlock data
  * A.K.A. "deadly embrace"
* Control techniques
  * Deadlock prevention
  * Deadlock detection
  * Deadlock avoidance
* Choice of deadlock control method depends on database environment
* Dining Philosophers
  * 5 phils
  * 5 forks
  * server solution
  * Queue solution
  * random decision solution
    * surprisingly works

## Concurrency Control with Time Stamping Methods (1 of 2)

* Time stamping assigns global, unique time stamp to each transaction
  * Produces explicit order in which transactions are submitted to DBMS
* Properties
  * Uniqueness: ensures no equal time stamp values exist
  * Monotonicity: ensures time stamp values always increases

## Concurrency Control with Time Stamping Methods (2 of 2)

* Disadvantages
  * Each value stored in the database requires two additional stamp fields
  * Increases memory needs
  * Increases the database’s processing overhead
  * Demands a lot of system resource

## Wait/die or Wound and Wait (1 of 2)

* Wait/die
  * A concurrency control scheme in which an older transaction must wait for the younger transaction to complete and release the locks before requesting the locks itself-Otherwise, the newer transaction dies and is rescheduled
* Wound/wait
  * A concurrency control scheme in which an older transaction can request the lock, preempt the younger transaction, and reschedule it-Otherwise, the newer transaction waits until the older transaction finis

## Concurrency Control with Optimisitc Methods (1 of 2)

* Optimisitc
  * Don't require locking
  * Transaction is exe
* Phases
  * Read phase
    * Transaction: Reads the database-Executes the needed computations-Makes the updates to a private copy of the database values
  * Validation phase
    * Transaction is validated to ensure that the changes made will not affect the integrity and consistency of the database
  * Write phase
    * Changes are permanently applied to the database
