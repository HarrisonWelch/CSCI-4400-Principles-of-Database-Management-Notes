# CSCI_4400_NOTES_1_22_2019.md

* Data consisits of raw facts
* Info results in processing data reveal meaning
  * requires context
  * Bedrock knowledge
  * Should be accurate, relevant, and timely
* Learn how to form info from data

## What is a database

* Shared, integrated computer that stores data
  * End-user data: raw facts of interest to end user
  * Matadata: data about data, through which we understand data
* DBMS
  * collection of programs
  * Manages the database stucture
  * Controls access to data stored

## Why databases?

* DBMS intermediary between the user and the database
  * Enables data to be processed
  * Presents the end user with an integrated

## Roles

* You interact with the DBMS
* Many users are web user

## Types of DBs

* Single user
* Multiuser
* Location
  * Cloud
* Purpose
  * General
  * Discipline focused
* Structure
  * Our data is going to be structured

## Why is design important

* Focuses on design 
* Ad-hoc is an often occurance
  * Any question, you have to be able to answer
* Good Design
* Bad Design
  * difficult to trace errors
  * may lead to poor performance

## Evolution of Data Processing

* Manual file systems
* Computer file systems
  * Data processing (DP) specialist created a computer-based system to track data and produce required reports
* File system redux: modern tools
  * Spreadsheet

## Terminology

* TERM - definition
* Data - raw facts
* Field - 
* Record - 
* File - 

## Evol of Data Processing (3 of 3)

* Avoid info stored in more than one place

## problems of data dependence

* Data dependence
* Data independence

## Data redundancy

* What is it? ... When you store info more than one time
* when you look it up, it can majically change states (value)
* Islands of info
  * data in parts in many locations

## Data redundancy Pt 2

* Results
  * poor data security
  * poor data consisitency
  * errors with data entry
  * data integrity
    * it is as it says it is
    * True is True
    * False is False
* "Don't want to do that"

## Data Anomalies

* Develop when not all data is kept away from redudancy
  * Updata Anomalies
  * Insertion Anomalies
  * Delete Anomalies
* Pg 15 in the textbook
  * On the 3rd, row we have a typo
  * The only way you know they are an agent is when they have a client
    * Insert Anomaly
  * What if we delete all customer from an agent
    * If we store redundant data this happens
    * We need a table
    * Delete Anomoly

## DB System Environment pt1

* Procedures
* data

## "" "" "" pt2

* image from book, DB system environment
* don't pay attention to job titles
* DB admin, then System Admin
  * same thing probably

## DBMS

* many user access control

## Manage the DB Shift in focus

* costs money
* time

## Summary

* Data consists of raw facts

`break time`

## Access

Where X is _____

* Location is Madrid OR Berlin
* You have the use of AND and OR and NOT
  * Logical "Connectives"
  * just like in programming
* All Customers who purchased an item in category 2

## Foreign Key

"The more you can push stuff to the user, the better off you are"
